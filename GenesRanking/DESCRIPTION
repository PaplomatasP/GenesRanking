Description: GenesRanking is an R package for identifying biomarkers from scRNA-seq data. It
  provides functions for preprocessing, statistical analysis, and machine
  learning to extract gene expression patterns and identify biomarkers. The
  package includes tools for gene filtering, normalization, differential
  expression and pathway analysis, and various machine learning models for
  classification and prediction. GenesRanking aims to identify key genes and
  pathways dysregulated in different cell types or disease states, providing
  insights into biological processes and potential therapeutic targets.
